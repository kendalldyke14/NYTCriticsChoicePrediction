His mid-20th century collaborations with composer John Cage (his lifelong partner) and visual artist Robert Rauschenberg were central to an era of transformation. Cunningham resisted ""avant-garde"" or any other label. ""I don't describe it. I do it,"" he once said. Now, with Cunningham, we have a chance to experience what he did. Filmmaker Alla Kovgan assembles the last generation of Cunningham dancers (led by Merce Cunningham Dance Company assistant director of choreography Jennifer Goggans) to present landmark works from the Cunningham repertoire. The film concentrates on the three decades from 1942 to 1972 when Cunningham was making his reputation. Gorgeously shot in 3D, Cunningham brings us closer to these works than any audience has ever been before. Taking an inventive approach with locations, the film places dancers in evocative backdrops such as a tunnel, a high-rise rooftop, and a forest. These current-day performances are interlaced with archival footage of Cunningham speaking and moving. We also hear illuminating interviews with Cage, Rauschenberg, and members of the original Merce Cunningham Dance Company, who endured years of rejection and outrage before they slowly won over audiences. ""I never believed that idea that dancing was the greatest of the arts,"" said Cunningham. ""But when it clicks, there's the rub. It becomes memorable. And one can be seduced all over again."" Whether you come to Cunningham as a neophyte or an aficionado, you'll leave with a rich experience of his art.",English,"Germany, France, United States, United Kingdom",1 win & 6 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2YxZDJkMjctOTRhZS00MGM5LWI5NWItMjRlNzFjOTZiYzI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA2MDU0NjM5._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.5/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '89%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '83/100'}]",83,6.5,387,tt8574836,movie,03 Jan 2020,"$265,102",N/A,N/A,True,

Shot from 2016 to 2018, The Cave belongs to the top rank of war films. Syrian director Feras Fayyad takes us to a subterranean landscape that feels akin to the post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max (1979). With life too dangerous above ground, survivors create a network of secret tunnels under the city of Ghouta, near Damascus, for an underground hospital maintained by women doctors. In contrast to the many Syrian documentaries made from cellphone footage or shaky cameras, Feras Fayyad takes great care to visualize the landscape and its memorable occupants with artful cinematography. For anyone who feels jaded by Syria coverage, this work stands apart. The heart of the film is Dr. Amani, a young Syrian woman operating in unimaginable conditions with great humor and fortitude. When not tending to patients - many of whom are small children - she's forced to justify her work to chauvinistic men who insist that a woman should be at home fulfilling domestic duties, not running a hospital. The claustrophobia of Amani's workplace is mitigated by the high spirits of her crew, while occasional forays above ground temper relief from close quarters with harrowing scenes of a city reduced to rubble.","Arabic, English","Denmark, Germany, France, United Kingdom, United States, Qatar, Syria",Nominated for 1 Oscar. 21 wins & 23 nominations total,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RiZjcxMmMtZGFhOS00MGU4LTk0YTItZGRmZTc0ZmM2Y2MzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjgzMjQ0MTA@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.5/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '97%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '83/100'}]",83,7.5,"2,651",tt7178226,movie,14 Jan 2020,"$62,625",N/A,N/A,True,

With incredible strength and positive energy, Deborah Feldman, Leyla Hussein, Rokudenashiko, Doris Wagner and Vithika Yadav are fighting for sexual liberation and autonomy for women, beyond religious rules and cultural barriers. But their victory comes at a high price: they all have experienced public defamation, threats and prosecutions, have been excommunicated by the society they grew up in and even received death threats by religious leaders and fanatics. #FEMALE PLEASURE shows the universal mechanisms at work that determine the position of women until today, spanning cultures, religions and continents: from Japan and India and the Somali Muslim diaspora to the Hasidic community in Brooklyn and the Catholic clergy in Europe. All protagonists have come to the same conclusion: the female body is subjected to male lust and first and foremost meant for procreation, without any regard for female sexual pleasure and autonomy. These women decided to speak up and are the ultimate example on how courage, strength and zest for life can indeed alter societal structures.","English, German, Japanese","Switzerland, Germany",7 wins & 7 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWJhOTc4NWYtNzFhOC00YTk5LTg4Y2UtN2U2MTcxMmI3ZGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDExMzMxNjE@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.5/10'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '71/100'}]",71,7.5,572,tt8372826,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,

At great personal and professional risk, journalist Martin Bright published the leaked document in The Observer newspaper in London, and the story made headlines around the world. Members of the Security Council were outraged and any chance of a UN resolution in favour of war collapsed. But within days, Bush declared he no longer needed UN backing and invaded anyway. As Iraq descended into chaos, Katharine was arrested and charged with breaching the Official Secrets Act. Martin faced potential charges too. Their legal battles exposed the highest levels of government in both London and Washington with having manipulated intelligence in order to sell an illegal war.","English, Mandarin","United Kingdom, United States, Switzerland, China",5 wins & 16 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjY1NWYwZmEtNGE3Ny00YTZhLThmZTMtNGI2MDY0MGU5YmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODY3Nzc0OTk@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.3/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '82%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '63/100'}]",63,7.3,"43,239",tt5431890,movie,30 Aug 2019,"$1,988,546",N/A,N/A,True,

Against the odds Bill escaped a bleak future in post-war, working class London to find himself at the very centre of a musical and cultural revolution. As a Rolling Stone he embarked on record-breaking world tours, dealt with feuding band mates and befriended some of the world's most iconic musicians, actors, sportsmen and artists. Then, to people's amazement he walked away from it all to commit to a new family and to set about documenting and preserving the memory of the 'rock and roll revolution'. Since leaving the Stones Bill has toured the world with his all-star band the Rhythm Kings as well as exhibiting his renowned photography. A keen archaeologist, Bill acts as a historical consultant on film and documentary projects and has written nine books on a variety of subjects. Throughout his career Bill shot hours of unseen film footage, took thousands of photographs, collected a vast archive of memorabilia and kept a detailed diary of each and every single day.

Having been pushed out by circumstances like many others, Jimmie, who works a low paying job as a nurse in a seniors' care facility, returned to San Francisco three years ago and has been living in his best friend Montgomery Allen's house that he shares with his blind grandfather, Jimmie who sleeps on the floor in Mont's already cramped bedroom. Despite the house, Mont's situation is not much better than Jimmie's, Mont who works at a supermarket fish counter while he sketches and writes a play on the side. Other black people around him who are showing their anger in also being disenfranchised from San Francisco life are the soapbox preacher who Jimmie and Mont often watch as they wait for the bus, and a group of young black men who hang outside of Mont's house. All of Jimmie's family, who he rarely sees, are also disenfranchised from that San Francisco life in one way or another: his estranged father lives in an SRO; his mother and her new husband long moved to Los Angeles; and his paternal Auntie Wanda has been pushed out to the suburbs. Jimmie has long wanted to reclaim what he sees as his place in San Francisco, which to him means the house he grew up in and which his same named paternal grandfather built in the post-war era in a style indicative to the area a century earlier. The problems are that his father lost the house long ago, the neighborhood has since been gentrified from the immigrant neighborhood it once was, increasing the value of the house to the several millions, and a white couple currently lives there, there being no indication that they are either planning on leaving or selling even if Jimmie could afford it.

At a preseason football party in small-town Steubenville, Ohio, a heinous crime took place: the assault of a teenage girl by members of the beloved high school football team. What transpired would garner national attention and result in the sentencing of two key offenders. But it was the disturbing social media evidence uncovered online by crime blogger Alex Goddard that provoked the most powerful questions about the case, and about the collusion of teen bystanders, teachers, parents and coaches to protect the assailants and discredit the victim. As it painstakingly reconstructs the night of the crime and its aftermath, Roll Red Roll uncovers the ingrained rape culture at the heart of the incident, acting as a cautionary tale about what can happen when teenage social media bullying runs rampant and adults look the other way.

Almost 1700 will survive the horrors of the war in Berlin. The Invisibles tells the stories of four of these contemporary witnesses. Hanni Lévy, who has just turned 17, has lost both of her parents. Thanks to her dyed, blonde hair, she is practically invisible to her pursuers, and strolls along the Ku'damm to pass the time away. Cioma Schönhaus has also gone underground and leads an adventurous life that consists of buying a sailboat, dining in Berlin's best restaurants, and becoming a forger of passports, through which he saves the lives of dozens of other Jews.

The film is a darkly funny and sometimes brutal affair. After ridiculing his girlfriend, director Astor Williams Stevenson finds himself single and trying to discover what exactly it is he wants. At the same time, he attempts to get a film off the ground and soon learns that his creative vision will not align with that of his crew. As Astor goes on a number of dates his abrasiveness and cynical attitude towards life seems to become ever more crystallized. The centerpiece of the film is a fearless performance from Clark as he embodies a man whose self-loathing is hidden by arrogance. Yet, for all his bluff and bluster Clark manages to add a sheen of vulnerability to make Astor a compelling and sympathetic character. While the film is reminiscent of great American cinema of the 1970's (with some slight echoes of the works of Woody Allen) with a somewhat staccato structure made up of disparate moments, this is still a thoroughly modern affair replete with some graphic sexuality and an often-harsh takedown on modern views of dating. Yet despite its moments of cynicism, this also manages to be a witty and funny affair and is a must for all those who appreciate strong voices within American cinema.",English,United States,7 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q0ZTgwNDUtMzc3Ni00MjUwLWE3MGQtZGRmOTc2NDA1MGE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA1OTA3NDE@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.0/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '88%'}]",N/A,5.0,131,tt5515814,movie,07 Dec 2018,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,
