All of Phil's romance, power and fragility is trapped in the past and in the land: He can castrate a bull calf with two swift slashes of his knife; he swims naked in the river, smearing his body with mud. He is a cowboy as raw as his hides. The year is 1925. The Burbank brothers are wealthy ranchers in Montana. At the Red Mill restaurant on their way to market, the brothers meet Rose, the widowed proprietress, and her impressionable son Peter. Phil behaves so cruelly he drives them both to tears, revelling in their hurt and rousing his fellow cowhands to laughter - all except his brother George, who comforts Rose then returns to marry her.

The highest-ranking Nazi in Nuremberg to be spared the death sentence, Speer was one of Hitler's closest confidants and his chief architect, tasked with rebuilding Berlin as the capital of a global empire. Appointed Minister of Armaments and War production in 1942, Speer was responsible for 12 million slave laborers. And yet, even now, he has the reputation of being ""the good Nazi"" - a myth he carefully constructed himself. The film meets its protagonist in 1971, while Speer was working on a screenplay for Paramount Pictures, based on his memoir ""Inside the Third Reich"". Based on forty hours of unpublished audio cassettes, recorded by screenwriter Andrew Birkin, it features Speer's callous attempt to whitewash his past with a feature film. The audio narrative is supplemented by rare archival footage, from before and during World War II, during the Nuremberg Trials and later, during Speer's retirement as a semi-reclusive country gentleman. At times juxtaposed and at times interwoven, those three timelines form the narrative of the film that provides ironic and chilling tension. Speer Goes to Hollywood is the film that Speer never made. Thanks to the cassettes, he is the narrator of his own life story, but in a way that he never imagined. The rare archival materials selected to illustrate his account offer us a chance to look beyond his words to ponder whether this eloquent but ultimately self-serving narcissist was recording history or recording his story?","English, German, French",Israel,2 wins & 3 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWZmNGNhNTctMzM5ZS00ODQwLTgxYWMtZDIzYWUyYmM0Yjc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjE4OTU2MzY@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.4/10'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '61/100'}]",61,7.4,54,tt11771734,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,

This is where imperial Germany's grand health resorts of Bansin, Heringsdorf and Ahlbeck were built. Heinz Brinkmann, who was born in Heringsdorf, traces the eventful history of his island. He talks about the magnificent villas on Europe's longest beach promenade, about the expulsion of Jewish citizens by the Nazis and about Usedom being split into a German and a Polish half after the Second World War. During the GDR era, most of the spa architecture remained intact because of the lack of means to build something new. Since the fall of the Wall, however, investors have been trying to replace it with indistinguishable luxury residences. Brinkmann also asks people about conservation and change. We hear from the mayor infuriated by the architectural eyesores of recent years, a farmer who bought an island in the Achterwasser lagoon for his organic cattle, a Polish hotel manageress and other bridge-builders between the two countries. Brinkmann also quotes from his own 1992 Usedom film and compares the plans of his former protagonists with today's reality.

Maia is an enthusiastic supporter of Israel, and the images in the videos, depicting Palestinian life under Israeli military rule, contradict some of her deep-seated beliefs. Empathy, anger, embarrassment, innate biases, and healthy curiosity -- all play out before our eyes as we watch her watch the images created by the Occupation. As Maia navigates and negotiates the images, which threaten her worldview, she also reflects on the way she sees them.

This tight-knit group of Afghan filmmakers loved cinema enough to risk their lives for art. Despite government interference, censorship boards, scarce resources, armed opposition, and near-constant threats of arrest or even death, they made films that were subversive and, in the filmmakers' opinions, always ""true"" to life. All five films - THE APRIL REVOLUTION, DOWNFALL, THE BLACK DIAMOND, WRONG WAY, and AGENT - completed principal photography before being canceled by the state or abandoned by the filmmakers. WHAT WE LEFT UNFINISHED brings together newly rediscovered and restored footage from these unfinished films with new footage shot in the same locations, and stories from behind the scenes, as told by the directors, actors and crew who worked on the films.

Jones and D-Man in the Waters is a feature documentary that traces the history and legacy of one of the most important works of art to come out of the age of AIDS - Bill T. Jones' tour de force ballet ""D-Man in the Waters"". In 1989, ""D-Man in the Waters"" gave physical manifestation to the fear, anger, grief, and hope for salvation that the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company felt as they were embattled by the AIDS pandemic. As a group of young dancers reconstructs the dance, they learn about this oft forgotten history and deepen their understanding of the power of art in a time of plague. Bill T. Jones is arguably the most socially, politically and emotionally compelling choreographer alive today. Thirty years ago, he embedded motifs of risk and sacrifice, love, loss and resurrection in the choreography for ""D-Man in the Waters"". Through an extraordinary series of interviews, archival material, and uniquely powerful cinematography of movement, this 90-minute, lyrical documentary uses the story of this dance to illustrate the triumph of the human spirit in art and in the community.

Overnight, video clips of the interaction went viral, Sandmann and his classmates hit with a tidal wave of worldwide outrage, their safety threatened and the entire Cov Cath community suddenly at the center of uncomfortable conversations about racism, privilege and politics.A graduate of that elite institution, filmmaker Jonathan Schroder watched the incident-and the subsequent media blowback-with keen interest, knowing firsthand the deeply formative nature of an adolescence spent inside the entitled Covington Catholic bubble. Seeking to better understand the scene on the steps, the people involved in it and its larger ramifications for the community, the media and our democracy as a whole, Schroder set out to investigate how one fleeting interaction can become a global controversy.

As New York City's preeminent No Wave icon from the late '70s, Lunch has forged a lifetime of music and spoken word performance devoted to the utter right of any woman to indulge, seek pleasure, and to say ""fuck you!"" as loud as any man. In this time of endless attacks on women this is a rallying cry to acknowledge the only thing that is going to bring us together - ART...as the universal salve to all of our traumas.LYDIA LUNCH - The War is Never Over by Beth B is the first career-spanning documentary retrospective of Lydia Lunch's confrontational, acerbic and always electric artistry. As New York City's preeminent No Wave icon from the late '70s, Lunch has forged a lifetime of music and spoken word performance devoted to the utter right of any woman to indulge, seek pleasure, and to say ""fuck you!"" as loud as any man. In this time of endless attacks on women this is a rallying cry to acknowledge the only thing that is going to bring us together - ART...as the universal salve to all of our traumas.In 2017, Lydia Lunch and filmmaker Beth B joined forces to create LYDIA LUNCH - The War Is Never Over a retrospective of Lunch's confrontational, acerbic and always electric spoken word performance and music. The film frames Lunch's work through the lens of the various philosophical themes that have obsessed her for years to enlighten and empower women to voice the unheard and to break the cycle of violence toward women throughout the world. Lydia Lunch is the psycho-sexual transgressive who revoked patriarchal expectations of what a female performer might mean, while forging a vocabulary of rare emotional honesty, philosophy and humor.Director Beth B has known and worked with No Wave legend Lydia Lunch since the late '70s when they broke boundaries in New York City, confronting audiences with uncensored poetry, music and films. Reflecting on the groundbreaking defiance Lydia Lunch has personified for over 30 years, she is a survivor who creates a dialogue of universal truth through her music and performances. In 1984, she penned the subversive and prescient spoken word piece, ""Daddy Dearest"", defying the gag order and spoke out about the sexual abuse she suffered as a young girl at the hands of her father. Lunch continues to expose the patriarchy, sexual abuse, the cycle of violence, and corporate greed with stubborn resistance.In 1976, at age sixteen, Lydia Lunch arrived in the bankrupted ruins of NYC with the killer instincts of a born survivor, inspired by the ravings of Lester Bangs in Creem Magazine, the Velvet Underground's sarcastic wit, the glamour of the New York Dolls, and the poetic scat of Patti Smith's Piss Factory. Having escaped a disrupted and abusive childhood, Lunch's refusal to submit to anyone's will led her to forge her own reality on stage with the unprecedented brutality of Teenage Jesus And The Jerks - a central pillar of the No Wave music scene and a legendary name to this day. Everyone from Alan Vega and Martin Rev (Suicide), to the future luminaries of Sonic Youth, would embrace Lunch as the violent heartbeat of their art/music rebellion. When Brian Eno chose to produce the No New York compilation of 1978, Lunch was there as the shrieking voice and guitar fronting one of the most influential bands of the era: Teenage Jesus And The Jerks.LYDIA LUNCH - The War is Never Over includes interviews with Lydia Lunch as well as some of her collaborators and colleagues including: Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth; performance artist Kembra Pfahler; Teenage Jesus bass player, Jim Sclavunos; Donita Sparks from L7; famed DJ and musician Nicolas Jaar; Art Critic Carlo McCormick; Filmmaker Richard Kern and a long list of other groundbreaking artists connected to Lunch's past and present.Filming in rehearsal and on tour with her band Retrovirus, the behind-the-scenes footage reveals a side of Lunch's personality that has been unseen. Her warmth and generosity in private interactions along with hilarious banter in the rehearsal studio with band members contrasts wonderfully with her brash, assaultive style of performance.",English,United States,1 nomination,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRkZTFlYzQtYTcwNC00YzAzLWI1NDItMzc3N2QwMzJmMTk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI3NDAyNg@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.3/10'}]",N/A,7.3,40,tt10367856,movie,N/A,"$12,948",N/A,N/A,True,

400,My Name Is Bulger,2021,N/A,17 Jun 2021,90 min,Documentary,Brendan J. Byrne,N/A,"Bill Bulger, James 'Whitey' Bulger","Greetings again from the darkness. Even those of us who aren't ""Southies"" know the name James ""Whitey"" Bulger. Johnny Depp portrayed him in BLACK MASS (2015) and Jack Nicholson's character was inspired by him in THE DEPARTED (2006). Of course, that's just cinema taking the legend and running with it. In the real world, we recall seeing the televised clips of the FBI capturing Bulger in California in 2011, after 16 years on the lam and being a fixture on the FBI's Most Wanted list ... and then seeing the reports of his being beaten to death at age 89 in a West Virginia prison mere hours after his transfer. Very suspicious - but who weeps for the mobster? Well, documentarian Brendan J Byrne offers some insight. It turns out, even mobsters have brothers and sisters and kin folk.It's the family ... one brother in particular ... that is the focus of this documentary. Whitey's younger brother Bill, was the President of the Massachusetts Senate for 18 years, after which he became President of the University of Massachusetts. To hear multiple people, including two former Governors describe Bill Bulger as principled and smart is a bit disconcerting. Is it possible for one family to have a brother so devoted to public service and another brother who is a criminal mastermind that murders people? It's beyond debate that Bill Bulger was an enormously popular politician. However, the question remains - and will likely never be answered - is whether Bill was able to keep his political decisions separate from his brother.The film begins with a family photo and we learn the faces and names of the Bulger clan, some who are interviewed in this film. When family loyalty is discussed, one says it shouldn't be tossed aside because one falters. Most of us would likely consider Whitey's criminal record as more extreme than a misstep or faltering, but the point is one to which most of us can relate.Bill Bulger, now 87 years old, and his wife Mary have been married for more than 60 years. They have 9 children and 33 grandchildren. Many of the kids participated in the film hoping to salvage the family legacy created by Bill as opposed to the more headline-grabbing exploits of Whitey, described as ""just another Uncle"". In addition to family members, interviews are conducted with Catherine Greig, Whitey's longtime partner (she was captured with him in California, and served her own prison sentence), a juror from Whitey's trial, a journalist and author - where the difference between Bill and Whitey is described as visible versus invisible, and former Massachusetts Governors Michael Dukakis and Bill Weld, both of whom had their own candidacies for President of the United States. These two men speak highly of Bill's character and political astuteness, despite his ongoing rivalry with ""The Boston Globe"".Bill is now retired and living a quiet life. There are still those in the family who claim his brother Whitey is ""not the monster he was made out to be"", although Bill's public statements seem to infer otherwise. Whitey's former Winter Hill Gang members were shocked at allegations that he had been an FBI informant, and the ""Where's Whitey"" manhunt is one that will likely be studied for years to come. Filmmaker Byrne does seem to have success in making the case that South Boston loyalty can co-exist with a family split by the polarized work of two members - brothers Bill and Whitey. It's quite fascinating to see how these contrasting elements fit together.",English,Ireland,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk5YzA5OWQtMzkxMC00YTUxLWEzZWItYzAyZDk1ZGM4YjhlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ3Njg3MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.6/10'}]",N/A,5.6,29,tt14818156,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,

Xavier is a stoic veteran of the ethnic wars that have plagued his country for years. Faustin is an eager young recruit who joined the army to avenge the death of his father and brothers. Under the relentless command of MAJOR KAYITARE, they march eighty kilometers a day in pursuit of the murderers of nearly one million Tutsis during the Rwandan genocide four years ago. One night, Xavier and Faustin are accidentally left behind when the battalion races out to chase fleeing rebels. They try to catch up, but must take refuge in the forest when local Congolese militiamen catch sight of them. Lost, with no hope of catching their men, they decide to press west through the jungle toward Kasai Province where Xavier believes the Major is headed next. It will not be easy. In the last war, Xavier saw hundreds die in the jungle without adequate supplies. Still, without their battalion they are as good as dead. After a few desperate weeks of hunger, Faustin finds a way to catch food with skills he learned back on his farm. Xavier keeps them out of trouble with local patrols and mercenary mining operations, saving Faustin's life on more than one occasion. Along the way, they grow close. Xavier learns that Faustin has a wife and vows to get him home to her. Xavier had a wife once, but she died while he was away fighting the last war. He believes it was God's punishment for the things he did then, when he and the Major chased rebel families into this forest and condemned them to die of hunger and sickness. When Xavier falls into the feverish grip of malaria, he's tortured by visions of the dead. Unable to walk, Faustin carries him on his back until they finally emerge from the forest, four months after plunging into its depths. A local village takes them in. Xavier recovers and learns that the Rwandan Army is camped on a mountain in the distance. He and Faustin set out to rejoin their troops, even though by now both question their place in the war. They reach the mountain, narrowly dodging the bullets of their own paranoid troops. Xavier and Faustin are separated and interrogated by a captain who believes them to be rebel spies. After several days, the Major hears of Xavier's return and comes to his aid. Faustin has been badly beaten and will die unless the Major sends him home to a hospital. Xavier begs him to help, but the Major refuses to waste fuel on one second-rate soldier. As Xavier grows insolent, the Major threatens to throw him back into the stockade to rot. Xavier insists the Major might as well shoot him if the private dies. Finally, the Major relents. As troops load Faustin into a supply truck bound for Rwanda, Xavier bids him a tearful goodbye and tells him to return home and raise his son in peace. That night, during a vicious rebel assault, Xavier refuses to shoot an enemy child soldier and is killed. Sometime later, Faustin raises crops with his wife and son back in Rwanda. He is forever grateful for Xavier's sacrifice, happy to be free of the jungle and done with war.","French, Swahili","Belgium, France, Rwanda",6 wins & 3 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzhiMDJkZjctNjM4ZC00Y2NjLWFjMjktZmQ0NmE2M2QzY2EwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODQzNzMxOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.2/10'}]",N/A,6.2,234,tt6396074,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,

In late 1960s, Joan Ganz Cooney, a socially conscious female television executive was working in the fledgling world of public television. She was asked by friend Lloyd Morrisett Jr., who worked for the Carnegie Corporation of New York and who specialized in the psychological studies of pre-school children, to take on revolutionary experiment. Could Joan create a children's show that would ""master the addictive qualities of television and do something good with them?"" Inspired by the civil rights movement, Joan and Lloyd took this experiment one step further and began to envision using the new medium of television to educate all children, and specifically reach America's ""inner city"" children to help close the educational gap that systemic racism and poverty had created. It was the right project, at the right time, and she needed the right group of people to make it happen. To harness the burgeoning power of television and create an educational, impactful, and entertaining show that could reach children nationwide. Cooney recruited visionary Muppets creator Jim Henson and acclaimed children's television writer and director Jon Stone to craft the iconic and uplifting world of what became Sesame Street. Street Gang: How We Got To Sesame Street focuses on the first two experimental and groundbreaking decades of Sesame Street, highlighting this visionary ""gang."" With interviews with the original surviving creators, and their families, we hear and see how ""the gang"" came together. They share stories of the challenges and stumbling blocks involved to create the show and its iconic characters, and also speak to confronting boundaries that came their way with unflinching purpose. All with a wicked sense of humor, and pure joy. The gang knew that they were part of something that was special, critically important, and bigger than themselves. Street Gang: How We Got To Sesame Street reintroduces the world to Joan's gang. With exclusive behind-the-scenes footage, and original cast and creator interviews, audiences will meet the people that audaciously interpreted radical changes in society and engaged children in ways that entertained and educated them like never before.

If we, as individuals, families and nations, band together by pursuing smaller families, supporting the worldwide adoption of accessible and affordable family planning, and strengthening our global commitment to the education and empowerment of women and girls, we will not only bring tremendous social justice, economic prosperity and health equity to billions, but we will unequivocally restore the environment.",English,United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmU3OGRjZjUtZGU2Yy00OTA4LWI0ZGYtMDVjNzZlMWQ4NjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDgyNzEyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '9.2/10'}]",N/A,9.2,13,tt10630982,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,

514,Bill Traylor: Chasing Ghosts,2019,N/A,16 Apr 2021,75 min,Documentary,Jeffrey Wolf,Fred Barron,"Russell G. Jones, Jason Samuels Smith, Sharon Washington","An inventive feature documentary capturing the vivid life of Bill Traylor, who in his late 80s, living homeless on the street in the thriving segregated black neighborhood of Montgomery, produced a body of extraordinary art. Born into slavery in 1853 on a cotton plantation in rural Alabama, Traylor witnessed profound social and political change during his life spanning slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow segregation, and the Great Migration. In his later years, Traylor poured out those memories from within, drawing and painting over 1,000 pieces of art from 1939-42. Using historic and cultural context, the film is designed to bring the spirit and mystery of Traylor's incomparable art to life. The transcendent surprise is while Traylor kept to himself leading an unassuming life, he was nurturing a remarkable creative gift that would not be expressed for decades. Tap dance, evocative period and original music, and dramatic readings are used in surprising ways in the film, balanced with insightful perspectives from Traylor family members and expert interviews. Traylor devised his own visual language to record the stories of his life, translating an oral culture into something unique, powerful, and culturally rooted. The film reflects a tumultuous time of a forgotten world and its marginalized people, still reverberating today. A new lynching memorial and Legacy Museum recently opened in Montgomery just blocks from where Bill Traylor used to sit and work. Bill Traylor: Chasing Ghosts explores the life of a unique American artist, a man with a remarkable and unlikely biography. The film is a compelling human narrative that gives voice to a man who endures a long life of extreme hardships during an era of legalized racial indignities, to become one of America's most prominent artists, exhibited in museums and collections worldwide.",English,United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDgxYTk3ZTctNGE2MS00ZTdiLWFhZDktMmJlMWNkNDZmYWFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDcwNzI3Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.9/10'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '80/100'}]",80,6.9,17,tt9108510,movie,N/A,"$4,504",N/A,N/A,True,

Desired by the wealthiest patrons in the world, it remains a pungent but rarified mystery. It cannot be cultivated or found, even by the most resourceful of modern excavators. The only souls on Earth who know how to dig it up are a tiny circle of canines and their silver-haired human companions-Italian elders with walking sticks and devilish senses of humor-who only scour for the truffle at night so as not to leave any clues for others. Still, this small enclave of hunters induces a feverish buying market that spans the globe. With unprecedented access to the elusive truffle hunters, filmmakers Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw (The Last Race, 2018 Sundance Film Festival) follow this maddening cycle from the forest floor to the pristine restaurant plate. With a wily and absurdist flare, The Truffle Hunters captures a precarious ritual constantly threatened by greed and outside influences but still somehow protected by those clever, tight-lipped few who know how to unearth the magic within nature.",Italian,"Italy, Greece, United States",6 wins & 19 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjBiN2QyZDQtZGJkZS00YjJlLThlNTctYTZlYjU4NzdmYjNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.3/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '97%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '84/100'}]",84,7.3,"1,249",tt11394318,movie,17 Aug 2021,"$521,202",N/A,N/A,True,

With only the company of the recently departed and an ailing widow who expresses cryptic reservations as to the man's ability to carry out the task, he soon finds himself exposed to a terrifying haunting within the claustrophobic confines of a home that has become host to a malevolent entity. In what is essentially a one-man show, Dave Davis is profoundly affecting in his portrayal of the hesitant sentinel, exuding an empathetic combination of frayed nerves and timid weariness. Throughout this uncanny night, his vigil gradually transforms into a harrowing spiritual investigation of both his cursed surroundings and his pitiable past - a journey in which the very recesses of his community's collective trauma is confronted. By the surreal and unnerving climax, under the assured auspices of writer-director Keith Thomas - making his feature film debut - the plentiful, hair-raising scares give way to poignant catharsis with a specter of dread that is sure to stick with audiences and occupy their subsequent nightmares. Operating within the parameters of a horror sub-genre that more commonly trades in Christian mysticism, The Vigil uniquely unveils a supernatural domain less trodden.

Now charged with the hospice care of Amanda, a retired dancer ravaged by cancer, Maud's fervent faith quickly inspires an obsessive conviction that she must save her ward's soul from eternal damnation - whatever the cost. Making her feature-film debut, writer/director Rose Glass cannily lures the audience into this disturbed psyche, steadily setting up her veritable diary of a country nurse for an unnerving and ultimately shocking trajectory. Morfydd Clark (also at the Festival in The Personal History of David Copperfield) portrays the sanctimonious Maud with an intense stoicism that belies a disquieting vulnerability, as Maud desperately vies for absolution and solidarity from her embittered patient (an enthralling Jennifer Ehle, also at the Festival in Beneath the Blue Suburban Skies). Glass tenderly captures this relationship with an empathetic gaze that first assumes an ethereal, dreamlike atmosphere - but it isn't long before Maud's dogmatic candor incites an irreconcilable friction that spirals her mind into a suffocating confluence of creeping doubt and paranoia. As Glass tightens the screws on her misguided martyr, well-placed nods are made to religious horror forerunners like William Friedkin's The Exorcist, further contributing to the film's increasingly dread-filled malaise. And when this insidious fever climatically breaks, the consequences are devastating and terrifying in equal measure.","English, Welsh",United Kingdom,Nominated for 2 BAFTA Film 10 wins & 28 nominations total,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE3ZDg0OTktYjlhNC00ZmQ0LTk0YjktMDE1ZWE2YjIwMjk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDA4NzMyOA@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.7/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '92%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '83/100'}]",83,6.7,"28,313",tt7557108,movie,12 Feb 2021,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,
