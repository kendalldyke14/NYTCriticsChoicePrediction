The emerging problems by these milestones only highlight existing problems, such as the issue of exes, and the intense dislike and mistrust between her mother Patty and him. A traumatic incident leads to both going on a metaphysical journey of their lives together - their future based on how their life has been so far, and a revisiting of their past and what key moments actually meant in knowing what they know now. Each goes into this journey with a different mindset due to their different beliefs of their current state of being. The questions become whether they will emerge from the journey at all, and if they do whether the journey itself will lead them to a path of true happiness as a couple/family.","English, Spanish",United States,1 win & 2 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNkNmU2M2EtMzEwZS00M2E5LWFlOTYtZjU3ZGQ5MTU0YTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEyMjM2NDc2._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.8/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '74%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '66/100'}]",66,5.8,"1,263",tt8902978,movie,11 Dec 2020,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,

The elegant world of upper class Tamils, a minority group in a largely majority Sinhalese country. At 8, Arjie loves dressing up like a bride and acting out a bridal procession with his girl cousins. When he is discovered by the adults, he wonders why he's being called ""funny"", a word whose meaning he can't understand, though he knows it's a 'bad' thing. Arjie is taken up by his magnetic aunt Radha, who has just returned from Canada. Radha sees that Arjie is gay and is determined to protect him and build his self-worth. But her life gets complicated when she falls in love with Anil, a charismatic Sinhalese man. Their relationship crosses ethnic boundaries in a world that simmers with tensions between the Sinhalese and Tamils. Radha must choose between her family and her lover. Arjie, witnessing his aunt's journey, learns some bitter lessons about what is possible and not in the world. We flash forward to Arjie at 17, at a new school. There, Arjie falls in love with Shehan, a Sinhalese. Meanwhile, the ethnic tension spills over into civil war, during which the family end up fleeing to Canada as refugees. Arjie now is 'free' to pursue his sexual proclivities (homosexuality is still illegal in Sri Lanka). But freedom comes at a price. The price is the preconceptions a white society has about coloured people. On one level, Funny Boy is a coming-of-age love story and on another, a film about oppression of minorities, whether it is race, culture or sexuality.","English, Tamil, Sinhala","Canada, United States, India, Sri Lanka",5 wins & 7 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODIzOGNlZTgtZGMwOS00OTY2LTgwMTQtZjY3N2FlZTY2ZWEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MzA2MTk4._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.8/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '81%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '62/100'}]",62,5.8,848,tt13345636,movie,10 Dec 2020,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,

He focused on a seven-year-old Buddhist named Peyangki who lived in a monastery set against a stunning mountainous backdrop. Peyangki confides to the camera his hopes and fears about the arrival of electricity. That is the opening of Sing Me A Song which then skips to the present. Peyangki is an 17-year-old monk, still at the monastery, but now awaking to the alarm of the smartphone that is his constant tool for every minute of the day, even during prayers. The film follows Peyangki in his rural monastery as he forms, via WeChat, a virtual relationship with a barroom singer named Ugyen who lives in the capital, Thimphu. She sings him love songs while he saves money from collecting medicinal mushrooms to go visit her. We watch their long-distance relationship evolve from both sides. As with all internet dating, there are obfuscations and false projections about the future. Balmès is a master of observation as he demonstrated in his longitudinal study Babies, which chronicled the development of infants in different parts of the world.

That alcohol in the blood opens the mind to the outside world, problems seem smaller and creativity increases. We know it well; after the first glass of wine, the conversation lifts, the possibilities open up. Martin is a high school teacher. He feels old and tired. His students and their parents want him terminated to increase their average. Encouraged by the per mille theory, Martin and his three colleagues throw themselves into an experiment to maintain a constant alcohol impact in everyday life. If Churchill won World War II in a dense fog of spirits, what could the strong drops do for them and their students? The result is positive in the beginning. Martin's class is in a different way now, and the project is being promoted to a real academic study with the collection of results. Slowly, but surely, the alcohol makes the four friends and their surroundings loosen up. The results are rising, and they really begin to feel life. As the objects go inboard, the experiment progresses for some, and goes off track for others. It becomes clearer and clearer that alcohol can generate great results in world history, but that all daring can also have consequences. The film is described as a fun, touching and thought-provoking drama about friendship, freedom - and alcohol.","Danish, Swedish","Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands",Won 1 Oscar. 44 wins & 58 nominations total,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTNjM2Y2ZjgtMDc5NS00MDQ1LTgyNGYtYzYwMTAyNWQwYTMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjE4NzUxNDA@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.8/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '92%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '79/100'}]",79,7.8,"118,224",tt10288566,movie,18 Dec 2020,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,

He joins the group, though they've been reduced to just a dozen men with three Humvees and a surplus of cigarettes. Before his first day with Nineveh SWAT is over, Kawa will witness the rescue of a child and the death of several colleagues, take revenge on a man who betrayed him, and participate in the ambush of an ISIS stronghold.

With unprecedented access, White Noise tracks the rise of far-right nationalism by focusing on the lives of three of its main proponents: Mike Cernovich, a conspiracy theorist and sex blogger turned media entrepreneur; Lauren Southern, an anti-feminist, anti-immigration YouTube star; and Richard Spencer, a white-power ideologue. Directed and shot by Daniel Lombroso in his directorial debut, this film takes the viewer into the terrifying heart of the movement -- explosive protests, riotous parties, and the rooms where populist and racist ideologies are refined, weaponized, and injected into the mainstream. Just as the alt-right comes to prominence, infighting tears the movement apart. Spencer and Cernovich clash over the role of white nationalism in conservative politics. Southern struggles to reconcile her leadership role with the sexism and misogyny of her peers. Lawsuits mount and internecine fights erupt, but even as the alt-right fractures, its once-marginalized ideas find a foothold in mainstream discourse; in Republican politics; in the establishment right-wing press, especially Fox News -- and on the world's biggest social-media platforms.

The main topic of this film is arguably one of the most important issues of our time: social and economic immobility. Inequality has been on the rise in America for more than three decades. Middle and low income wages have remained stagnant or decreased while top earners have seen their wages increase 135% since 1979. Today, the top .1% of Americans owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. This film is incredibly timely because of the staggering state of inequality today, but this film is also important because it is new. By bringing the unique perspective of gender to this story, this film expands the conversation around the causes and solutions to America's inequality and division. With our history and experience in illuminating and challenging limiting gender narratives in our society, our documentary team is uniquely qualified to tell this story. Our first two films, Miss Representation and The Mask You Live In, lay the groundwork for understanding the impact of gender on individuals and communities in American society. We view The Great American Lie as the critical last film in this trilogy that will address the role of our gendered values on American society-at-large.",English,United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGQ0NGM1M2MtNDEyNS00NDMzLTgxNzEtNTE5MmE0MTBiMTc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTg3NjQ4MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '4.3/10'}]",N/A,4.3,206,tt9143084,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,

Over 12 years and three Olympic games Savon reportedly turned down an estimated 37 million dollars to leave the amateur ranks and follow in the footsteps of fellow countryman Joel Casamayor. The question is, why would Felix Savon turn down fame and fortune for doing what he clearly proved he was the best at? This is the question at the root of this story and perhaps many of the now slanderous rumors saturating Cuba about Savon's reasoning, was it loyalty, fear, or something else entirely? Having cultivated a close relationship with Cuba's popular leader Fidel Castro, perhaps Savon's loyalty would not allow him to betray his friend and President. Now nearly 20 years have past since his last Olympic championship and Savon is ready to set the record straight as he deals with tumultuous rumors of abuse, as well as economic hardships. Now as he is second guessing his decision to stay in Cuba, the great Felix Savon will answer the 37 million dollar question by showing us the country he loves through his own eyes. This is the story of Savon.","English, Spanish",Cuba,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VjM2NjYzAtOTc0Yy00MjQwLWExN2ItY2E2ZGI0MjEwMDVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODYxNzUzNjc@._V1_SX300.jpg,[],N/A,N/A,N/A,tt9647410,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,

His teenaged apprenticeship under commercial photography pioneer Yva - who perished in the Holocaust - coincided with his family's persecution under the rise of the Third Reich and the emergence of the striking aesthetics of infamous Nazi propagandist, filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl. He escaped with members of his family in 1938 and met his life partner June while in Australia working as a commercial photographer. The couple eventually settled in Paris where Helmut's gradual evolution beyond the, then, conservative confines of fashion photography coincided with the radical political upheaval of 60s France. Interpreting the most traumatic political and cultural shift in German history, Helmut established his artistic legacy by effectively channeling his past into an erotically charged, highly-subversive portfolio dominated by bold 'Aryan'-esque women in stilettos navigating the shadowy past of Helmut's motherland.

460,Blood Quantum,2019,Not Rated,28 Apr 2020,98 min,"Drama, Horror",Jeff Barnaby,Jeff Barnaby,"Michael Greyeyes, Elle-Máijá Tailfeathers, Forrest Goodluck","The term ""blood quantum"" refers to a colonial blood measurement system that is used to determine an individual's Indigenous status, and is criticized as a tool of control and erasure of Indigenous peoples. The words take on even more provocative implications as the title of Jeff Barnaby's sophomore feature, which grimly depicts an apocalyptic scenario where in an isolated ""Mi'gmaq"" community discover they are the only humans immune to a zombie plague. As the citizens of surrounding cities flee to the ""Mi'gmaq"" reserve in search of refuge from the outbreak, the community must reckon with whether to let the outsiders in - and thus risk not just the extinction of their tribe but of humanity, period. The severe and scathing portrait of post-colonial Indigenous life and culture that Barnaby previously captured in the acclaimed Rhymes for Young Ghouls here deftly collides with the iconography and violent hyperbole typical of the zombie genre. The Undead are spectacularly and gruesomely dispatched via samurai swords, chainsaws, shotguns, and makeshift axes, while the living - a terrific ensemble cast led by Michael Greyeyes (Woman Walks Ahead and Fear the Walking Dead) - endure the paranoid pressures that such dire straits foment. In this iteration, however, Barnaby takes full advantage of the canvas zombie films regularly afford for cultural critique, exploring racism, colonialism, and the very real threat of extinction that Indigenous communities have experienced for generations. Further accentuated by arresting animated chapter breaks that instill a cool comic-book aesthetic to its horrific proceedings, Blood Quantum is as powerful an entry into the annals of zombie cinema as the devastating conclusion to George Romero's 1968 original Night of the Living Dead, and a meaningful demonstration of how marginalized voices - when given the opportunity - can resurrect a tired genre with incendiary new life.","English, Micmac",Canada,9 wins & 7 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTc1ODE0ZDAtZWU4YS00OTFmLWJkYWItNmRkMzkzZmRlNTFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM0NTU5Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.6/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '90%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '63/100'}]",63,5.6,"4,033",tt7394674,movie,28 Apr 2020,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,

In this small town, bonds run as deep as the ocean and secrets are as thick as the morning fog. Each day, droves of men take to sea for the daily catch while a handful of women serve as the community's powerful, albeit discrete, operators. Though the self-interested code of the town's old guard has governed for years, our tale takes place as the tides are turning in Easter Cove. Mary Margaret Connolly, a beloved and integral town matriarch, has just passed away. In the wake of her death, her daughters, Mary Beth and Priscilla, face an uncertain future, haunted by bills and unpaid loans left behind. Priscilla tries to fill her mother's shoes by taking over the family fish shop while her younger sister Mary Beth refuses to accept the new responsibilities. The sisters find themselves at odds and Mary Beth stubbornly defends her dream of leaving town - even if it means abandoning Priscilla altogether. Meanwhile, across town, at a bed and breakfast-turned-brothel, established town elder and madame Enid Nora Devlin is up to business as usual, except for two huge problems: someone stole $50K in cash and one of her girls, Dee, has gone missing. With little else to do, she sends her muscle, an outsider named Gorski, in pursuit of the cash and Dee. After a series of chance wrong turns sets Gorski on a collision course with Mary Beth, she accidentally kills him and must turn to the only person she has left: her sister. Together, the Connolly sisters must cover up Mary Beth's mistake and figure out what to do with the mysterious bag of cash they found in his shack. When Dee's body washes up on shore, the town's remaining matriarchs - Doreen, Gail and Susie - snap into action. These three, along with Enid and Mary Margaret, have quietly maintained the code of conduct for decades, navigating the murky water of the town's dubious past.

The Civil is in full swing. The Bolsheviks are confronted with the most active resistance in Kholodniy Yar. The home parts of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky and Haydamaky ottomans are proclaimed as the so-called Kholodnoyarska Republic. The 15,000-strong united troops led by local ottomans control the major part of Cherkassy oblast. They look forward to news from the 100,000-strong Ukrainian-Polish Army concentrated at the western border. The Bolshevik propaganda labels Symon Petlyura and the Kholodniy Yar ottomans as looters and pogrom brigands. The local department of Cheka headed by Comrade Marconi has a multi-move scheme aimed at discrediting the Ukrainian anti-Bolshevik movement in the eyes of Europe and the rest of the world. The Kremlin invites a group of foreign journalists who are supposed to expose the Kholodniy Yar ""brigands"". One of them is a Romanian newspaper correspondent named Radulescu. But his real name is Dibrova and he is Petlyura's Cossack captain and resident and his mission is to coordinate the Kholodniy Yar ottomans' activities. He secretly gets off the train at the Kamyanka station. He overhears a conversation between Cheka officers from which he finds out that there is a mole in the Kholodniy Yar commanding staff and that his name (or nickname) is Kochubey. The agent's picture is shown on a Bolshevik poster among 13 rebel leaders, but Dibrova cannot see which face is Kochubey's. Dibrova understands that under the circumstances he cannot appear at the rebel headquarters: there is a mole, so any plans will be known to the enemy. He cannot sneak into the rebel camp disguised as a private, either: Marconi knows him by his distinctive mark: he is one-armed. Dibrova manages to contact Ataman Ruchka: he knows the man very well, and he did not see Ruchka's face on the poster which means he is not the mole. Ruchka's daughter Maria enlists as a nurse in a Bolshevik field hospital. She manages to get to the basement where Cheka keeps captive rebel ottomans suffering from typhus. A conversation with Petro Haydamaka narrows the circle of suspects to four. Besides the Dibrava-Marconi standoff, the film features a fierce battle between the Bolshevik and Ukrainian nationalist propaganda machines brought up by printed rhymed pamphlets. The plot leads to a discovery that the mole is the main author of the pamphlets and that the exchange of leaflets is, in fact, a means of communication between Marconi and Kochubey. This channel of communication is codenamed ""Marconi Option"". With the help of the mole the Cheka manages to provoke a big pogrom. Foreign journalists see its consequences. As a result, Europe denies Petlyura any military or financial aid. Nevertheless, even knowing that they are doomed, the Kholodniy Yar rebels stand up to confront the Bolshevik enemy. They are defeated but unbroken.","Russian, Ukrainian",Ukraine,1 nomination.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTI5MzNlM2EtMDA1Zi00YTA2LWEyZjAtZmUyZDU5YmYzN2E0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjk1NzAxNg@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.7/10'}]",N/A,5.7,30,tt3858748,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,

Once believed to be the wealthiest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky rocketed to prosperity and prominence in the 1990s, served a decade in prison, and became an unlikely leader of the anti-Putin movement. In tracking Mikhail Khodorkovsky's story, Alex Gibney creates a compelling portrait of post-Soviet Russia, a nation caught between radically divergent political models - and where fortunes can transform overnight. The collapse of the USSR ushered in an era of chaos and opportunity. With laws lagging behind socioeconomic change, Russia fomented a kind of gangster capitalism. Mikhail Khodorkovsky took advantage of the privatization of state assets, created Russia's first commercial bank, and built Yukos, Russia's biggest oil company. His success in business was accompanied by a level of political influence that would prove precarious. In 2003, just months after publicly criticizing corruption within Vladimir Putin's government, Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested for fraud, and Yukos' shares were frozen and conveyed to the Russian state. He was found guilty, and sentenced to nine years' incarceration. Then, in 2010, Mikhail Khodorkovsky was hit with new charges of embezzlement and money laundering: he was essentially accused by the state of stealing his own oil, in what many recognized as a show trial.","Russian, English","United Kingdom, United States",7 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmJkZjFhMDItNzZlNi00ODA5LTkwZDktMGE2M2Y2Zjc1OTQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTM5NzYzNTU@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.0/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '95%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '76/100'}]",76,7.0,"1,046",tt10703826,movie,07 Apr 2020,"$120,411",N/A,N/A,True,

Seen as a victim in Germany and a perpetrator in Palestine, Ofra faces those she was raised to hate and dismiss as she searches to understand the identity-making narratives of the Holocaust and the Nakba, violent and non-violent resistance, and the possibility of forgiveness.","English, German, Arabic, Hebrew",United States,2 wins & 1 nomination,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE3NzY5MTItNjg2Ni00YTZjLThmZDYtMWQ2ODM1MjM3ODAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA4OTgwNzE@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '8.9/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '88%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '66/100'}]",66,8.9,77,tt9010460,movie,27 Jan 2020,"$6,477",N/A,N/A,True,

When she returned home a year later armed with ground-breaking research, the insurmountable barriers she faced as a female scientist proved much harder to overcome. In 1972, having published 20 research papers as an assistant professor of zoology at University of Guelph, the Dean of the university, denied her tenure. She couldn't apply to the University of Waterloo because the Dean there told Anne that he would never give tenure to a married woman. This was the catalyst that transformed Anne into a feminist activist. For three decades, Anne Innis Dagg was absent from the giraffe world until 2010 when she was sought out by giraffologists and not just brought back to into the fold, but finally celebrated for her work.",English,Canada,3 wins & 1 nomination,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWVmZmEzNmQtNzFmMC00ODU4LWFiMjUtNDdjYjFmYWQ0NDI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI3NDAyNg@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.7/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '100%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '71/100'}]",71,7.7,226,tt8901942,movie,05 Apr 2020,"$113,858",N/A,N/A,True,

Dr. Stone pioneers a simple, yet revolutionary treatment: instead of submitting the patients to electroshock, forced restraints and tranquilizers, he puts them in a room together to confront their delusions.
